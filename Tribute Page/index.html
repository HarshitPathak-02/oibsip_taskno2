                    as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style.
                    Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004, against Bangladesh in Chittagong,
                    and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. He played his first T20I also a year later against South Africa. In 2007, he took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid and he also selected as T20I captain of India in this year. In 2008,

                    <div class="things-card">
                        <h2>Calm and Composed!</h2>
                        <img src="./Assets/first.jpg" alt="Calm and composed">
                        <p>If there’s one person who comes to mind when you read that sentence, it’s MSD. Whether he’s chasing down an ambitious total, blasting sixes out of the stadium or even losing an easily winnable match, you will find him calm, composed and courteous!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="things-card">
                        <h2>Clever!</h2>
                        <img src="./Assets/second.jpg" alt="clever">
                        <p>For MSD, finding opportunities is like finding grains of sand on a beach! He thinks on his feet and his presence of mind on the field has helped us win matches, even under tough circumstances.
                            Do you remember the famous leg stump incident when the Rising Pune Giants took on the RCB? In what was an unorthodox yet highly effective move, Dhoni stopped a late cut with his right foot and prevented the ball from going past him!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="things-card">
                        <h2>Courageous!</h2>
                        <img src="./Assets/third.jpg" alt="courageous">
                        <p>There’s something about big matches and Dhoni. You never know when he’s going to spring one on you! Talking about surprises, remember the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup? When millions sat in front of their TV screens, clutching their poor hearts in immense confusion and anxiety, Dhoni unleashed Joginder Sharma on the field. After the first wide, and the second 6, India was practically hyperventilating.
                            But after a quick strategy break, Joginder Sharma was able to clinch the most important wicket and win the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup for India.
                            Dhoni, you really pulled one on us there, buddy! Phew!</p>
                    </div>

                        <img src="./Assets/fourth.jpg" alt="nimble">
                        <p>Let’s just take a moment here and bow down to this God who runs between the wickets like his life depended on it! An interesting analysis on Quora reveals that Dhoni actually ran faster than Usain Bolt in one particular match against England in their 3rd ODI in 2006!
                            A captain who leads by example, he knows the importance of rotating the strike between the wickets and also pushes his team members to be equally fit and agile. Don’t believe me, take a look at the collective fielding marvels produced under Dhoni – Kohli, Jadeja, Raina… even Yuvraj!</p>

                        <img src="./Assets/five.jpg" alt="discerning">
                        <p>April 2nd, 2011 – An out of form captain who barely scraped 150 runs in 8 matches promoted himself above a superbly performing player in a high adrenaline final! Normally, the outcome of such a story cannot be predicted to be favourable, especially for the captain. But, not when the captain is MS Dhoni.
                            With a breathtaking 91 not out against Sri Lanka, Dhoni confidently led the team to a glorious victory to make World Cup history! He not only won the final, he also won the hearts and respect of a cricket frenzy nation that is unforgiving and highly critical of its players!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="things-card">
                        <h2>Enterprising!</h2>
                        <img src="./Assets/six.jpg" alt="enterprising">
                        <p>In 2007, when the beloved Sourav Ganguly stepped down as captain of the Indian team, the mood of the entire nation was tense, uncertain and definitely apprehensive. Dhoni with his long locks and unconventional cricketing shots had just been appointed captain next. We didn’t know what to expect.
                            But 10 years later, there is only one voice – Thank you!
                            Indians stand together, proud & united in their praise for Dhoni, for he didn’t just a build a dynamic, youthful, aggressive team. He inspired millions of ambitious yet courteous fans who enjoy the spirit of the game without sacrificing their hopes for the team!</p>

                    <div class="things-card">
                        <h2>Pragmatic!</h2>
                        <img src="./Assets/seven.jpg" alt="pragmatic">
                        <p>A sign of a great leader is knowing when to pass the torch. After Virat Kohli’s roaring success as captain against England in the recent clash between the nations, Dhoni steps down from ODI & T20 formats as well, leaving behind a younger, fitter and equally ambitious captain to take on.
                            After registering the 5th consecutive win for India, who could question Dhoni’s decision to leave it in Kohli’s able hands?
                            Thank you, MSD – for fulfilling our dreams, raising the bar and leaving behind big shoes to fill! You will be missed.</p>
